# If you are interested in more ways to treat a scan, ScanTailor is definitely
# an option. I am using a fork called ScanTailor Advanced which is available on
# https://github.com/4lex4/scantailor-advanced
# With this tool you can also crop your images and apply options like threshold
# or posterization to improve readability while further reducing the file size.

OUTPUT=$2;

for f in *.pdf
do
  # gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/printer -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile="_${f}" "${f}"

  # Use the following line to compress the images in your pdf.
  # If the quality of the output is not sufficent you could try to replace ebook with printer.
  # This uses a higher resolution and therefore looks better while needing more disk space.
  # ! Select proper option depends on type of PDF: text, scans (lot of large images), etc.

  # -dPDFSETTINGS=configuration
  # The ‘best’ quality (where best means closest to the original input) is obtained
  # by not setting this parameter at all (or by using /default).
  # The PDFSETTINGS presets should only be used if you are sure you understand
  # that the output will be altered in a variety of ways from the input.
  #
  # Presets the "distiller parameters" to one of four predefined settings:
  #  /screen (72 dpi) selects low-resolution output similar to the Acrobat Distiller (up to version X) "Screen Optimized" setting.
  #  /ebook (150 dpi) selects medium-resolution output similar to the Acrobat Distiller (up to version X) "eBook" setting.
  #  /printer (300 dpi) selects output similar to the Acrobat Distiller "Print Optimized" (up to version X) setting.
  #  /prepress (300 dpi) selects output similar to Acrobat Distiller "Prepress Optimized" (up to version X) setting.
  #  /default (72 dpi) selects output intended to be useful across a wide variety of uses, possibly at the expense of a larger output file.

  # -dNOPAUSE
  # Disables the prompt and pause at the end of each page.
  # Normally one should use this (along with -dBATCH) when producing output on
  # a printer or to a file; it also may be desirable for applications where
  # another program is "driving" Ghostscript.

  # -dBATCH
  # Causes Ghostscript to exit after processing all files named on the command
  # line, rather than going into an interactive loop reading PostScript commands.
  # Equivalent to putting -c quit at the end of the command line.

  # -dQUIET
  # Suppresses routine information comments on standard output. This is currently
  # necessary when redirecting device output to standard output.

  gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/printer -dNOPAUSE  -dBATCH -sOutputFile="_${f}" "${f}"
  # gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sOutputFile="_${f}" "${f}"
